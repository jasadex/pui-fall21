			<h1>Same-Sex Relationship Stability</h1>
			<h2>Are we really different?</h2>
			<img src="../assets/images/stability.jpg" alt="relationship-stability">
			<p>From a glance at data, stability of same-sex couples appears to rest in part on whether they are legally married, formalized (registered partnership, domestic partnership), cohabitating, or dating. In fact, legalized same-sex relationships are just as stable as legalized different-sex relationships, if not more stable. This could be explained by saying that marriage has a protective effect, or that more stable couples would gravitate toward marriage. Over the years, gaps in the stability of same-sex and different-sex unmarried relationships appear to be weakening over time!</p>
			<p>Below, we discuss some factors identified by research as players uniquely affecting same-sex relationship stability</p>
		</div>
		<!-- Barriers to Dissolution-->
		<div id="legal" class="container-fluid">
			<h2>Barriers to Dissolution</h2>
			<p>The right to legally marry has been a fundamental way where same-sex couples differ from different-sex couples. Therefore, there are fewer legal barriers to dissolution for same-sex couples. In some sense, marriage enforces trust and relationship investments, and same-sex couples are destabilized by low rates of marriage.</p>
		</div>
		<!-- Minority Stressors-->
		<div id="stressors" class="container-fluid">
			<h2>Minority Stressors</h2>
			<p>Minority stressors can diminish the quality of romantic relationships. For same-sex couples, these could include interpersonal and institutional discrimination, negotiating and managing the visibility of their relationship among friends, family members, and coworkers, whereas different-sex couples are less likely to anticipate and experience disapproval.</p>
			<p>Experiencing these stresses could potentially make same-sex couples less likely to invest in relationship for example in the forms of moving in together, integrating their partner into their social networks, and other investments that can potentially stabilize relationships.</p>
			<p>Sexual composition of different same-sex couples also leads to some unique stressors. For example, male couples were shown to experience more stress related to violence and harassment, and female couples were shown to experience more stress related to family reactions.</p>
		</div>
		<!-- Sex Composition-->
		<div id="sex" class="container-fluid">
			<h2>Sex Composition</h2>
			<p>Many scholars refer to the “gender-as-relational” perspective when they explain differences in the relationship experience between same-sex and different-sex couples. The “gender-as-relational” perspective considers gender as dynamic and situational, with attention to differences among women and among men. Therefore, dynamics of relationships would unfold in different ways for couples with two men in comparison with with two women or with one man and a woman.</p>
			<p>Typically, same-sex relationships reinforce gendered tendencies, while different-sex relationships challenge these tendencies. For example, gendered ideas about men and masculinity are likely to play out differently depending on whether one's partner is a man or a woman, and men partnered with men may be more likely to mutually reinforce certain aspects of intimacy associated with masculinity, such as strong boundaries between partners (e.g., autonomy and independence), whereas a man partnered with a woman might not be reinforced and might even be challenged for such behavior by their female partner.</p>
			<p>As a result, researchers observed oppositional patterns of emotional intimacy and autonomy in male and female couples. For example, female partners in same-sex couples often report sharing their thoughts and feelings and attending to each other’s emotional needs to enhance emotional intimacy and minimize boundaries, while male couples would more often spend considerable effort respecting each other’s boundaries and providing emotional space.</p>
		</div>
		<!-- Intimacy-->
		<div id="intimacy" class="container-fluid">
			<h2>Intimacy</h2>
			<p>Men in same-sex relationships are more likely to approve of and have sexual relationships outside of their committed relationship, and to separate sex from emotional intimacy. This is often displayed in male couples as separating sex from emotional intimacy. According to research, men in gay relationships rarely saw sex as a way to create intimacy between partners, and in the majority of cases where gay partners no longer had sex, the absence of sex did not diminish a sense of intimacy and closeness between partners. In one interview study conducted in 2016, about half of the men in gay relationships emphasized that although sex with their partner had the power to enhance emotional intimacy, sex was neither critical to the long-term success of their relationship nor an indicator of how emotionally connected and committed they were to each other.</p>
		</div>
		<!-- Emotional Space-->
		<div id="space" class="container-fluid">
			<h2>Emotional Space</h2>
			<p>More men than women in same-sex and different-sex relationships discussed the creation of boundaries and emotional space between partners, and they see this as positive for relationship intimacy. As a result, men in gay relationships were more likely to be in agreement with their partner about boundaries and intimacy. In the same study, approximately one third of men in gay relationships emphasized the importance of providing each other with sufficient emotional space and respecting boundaries.</p>
			<p>However, boundary maintenance did not mean the absence of emotion work. Men in gay relationships were more likely than heterosexual men or lesbian partners to report emotion work directed toward maintaining boundaries as a method to promote partner or relationship well-being. Ideally, this emotion work is mutual and involves working to avoid discussion of personal or sensitive matters—sometimes repressing one's own emotions for the sake of a partner's emotions and preferences.</p>
		</div>
		<!-- Emotional Space-->
		<div id="exclusivity" class="container-fluid">
			<h2>Sexual Exclusivity</h2>
			<p>Data shows that sexual exclusivity was less important to men in same-sex relationships, and this could be attributed to their tendency to separate sex and emotional intimacy. Nearly half of the men in gay relationships said they would be okay with their partner having a sexual affair. In practice, men partnered with men are also more likely to report sexual encounters outside their primary relationship, and to indicate that such sexual encounters pose minimal threat to their long-term relationship, as long as emotional intimacy was absent.</p>
			<p>Although gay men were more likely to consider sex as separable from emotional intimacy, partners in male couples also often diverge from their partner on the importance of separating sex and intimacy. Thus, sexual nonexclusivity often involve some degree of negotiation and emotion work wherein the partner who desired exclusivity worked to accept the situation.</p>
			<p>However, for long term, even when men in gay relationships support sexual nonexclusivity, casual sexual encounters were rare. Gay couples are both more relationship focused and less likely to have sex outside of their long-term relationships than stereotypes suggest.</p>

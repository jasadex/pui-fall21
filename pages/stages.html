			<h2>Meeting a partner</h2>
			<p>Meeting a potential partner is the first milestone in any relationships. Based on a research conducted in 2015, nearly two thirds of young LGBT couples met through a mutual friend in an LGBT social circle or through LGBT-specific and non-LGBT specific social network sites. Notably, social networks and phone lines are more commonly used to meet LGBT peers and not necessarily to find a partner.</p>
			<p>After meeting potential partners, couples engage in a “talking” period before dating, similar to heterosexual couples. This is when couples get to know each other more, either in person or online, as well as determining the suitability of a romantic partner. This “talking” period can range from less than a week to several years.</p>

			<h2>Dating</h2>
			<p>Dating usually marks the start of a couple’s formal relationships. Nothing unlike heterosexual couples, dating young LGBT couples spend more time together, develop greater intimacy, and use relationship labels like “boyfriend” “girlfriend”.</p>
			<p>Similar to same-sex couples, common topics during “dating” such as hanging out, having sex, condom use, and getting tested for STIs. As relationships progress, especially for male couples, people reported less consistent condom use. In contrast, data shows that female couples are more likely to wait longer to have sex than male couples.</p>

			<h2>Relationship agreements</h2>
			<p>Relationship agreements are critical to all couples. One of the important agreement is whether the couple is monogamous or non-monogamous. This agreement is formed through discussions, and might include plan of condom use for primary and outside partners. As reported in research, this agreement can also be modified as relationships progress, or be assumed based on how couples interact.</p>

			<h2>Living together</h2>
			<p>Living together is another milestone frequently seen in relationships. In young LGBT communities, female couples discuss this milestone more frequently than male couples and also showed higher rate of cohabitation. </p>
			<p>The decision to live together can happen at any stages during a relationship. Some couples move in together shortly after they started to date out of necessity, for example due to parental rejection or finances. However, most couples that moved in together quickly didn’t feel ready. Some couples wait for longer to make the decision of living together, and this often demonstrates commitment to a relationship. Some factors can complicate this decision, for example the prospect of breaking up, handling finances with partner, or negative experiences of cohabitating with a previous partner.</p>

			<h1>Commitment</h1>
			<h2>Various types</h2>
			<p>Commitment to a relationship can be shown in many ways. One common way is introducing one’s partner to their family or friends. This introduction can often be stressful and sometimes receive disapproval from families and friends.</p>
			<p>Another way to further commitment to a relationship is through engagement and marriage. This is more frequently seen in female couples than their male counterparts.</p>
			<p>Having children is also a way of furthering commitment, and many see this as part of forming a family with their partner. In LGBT communities, this can be achieved by forming step-families, adoption, and in vitro fertilization. However, medically assisted conception and many legal processes can become barriers to having children for same-sex couples.</p>
			<p>While female couples discuss more about having children, male couples more commonly describe plans to start a family instead. This could be motivated by a desire to establish long-term commitment to one’s partner, and also by positive experiences growing up in a nuclear family.</p>
